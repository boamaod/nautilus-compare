# Context menu diff extension for Nautilus file manager

Context menu diff extension adds `Compare`, `Compare to ~/foo/bar` and `Compare Later` to the right-click menu of _Nautilus file manager_. By default _Meld diff and merge tool_ is used to do the comparison. Other applications for performing standard diffs, three-way diffs and multi-diffs can be conveniently selected and switched from the preferences dialog.

There are installation packages available for the latest versions of Debian and Ubuntu (also from the PPA).

The extension is a rewrite of `diff-ext` extension, discontinued in 2011. Usage of the context menu is described at:

The project is managed at Launchpad:
