Name: Nautilus Compare extension requires restarting file manager
Priority: High
Terminal: False
DontShowAfterReboot: True
DisplayIf: pgrep -x nautilus
Description: Nautilus Compare extension has been installed. Restart Nautilus file manager to make new context menu items 'Compare' and 'Compare Later' appear (hint: 'nautilus -q' in terminal). Or if you prefer, a session restart will be more than enough. Note that you also have to restart Nautilus after using 'nautilus-compare-preferences' to change the 'diff' tools used for the comparison.
