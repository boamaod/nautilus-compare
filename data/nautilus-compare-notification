Name: Nautilus Compare Extension requires restarting Nautilus
Priority: High
Terminal: False
DontShowAfterReboot: True
DisplayIf: pgrep -x nautilus
Description: Nautilus Compare Extension has been installed. Restart of Nautilus is needed to make it work properly (hint: 'nautilus -q' in terminal). Or if you prefer, a session restart will be more than enough. After restart, a new option will emerge in Nautilus context menu. This option lets you compare selected files with your preferred 'diff' tool as well as select files for later comparison.
