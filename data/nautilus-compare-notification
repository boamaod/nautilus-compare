Description: Nautilus Compare extension has been installed. Restart Nautilus file manager to make new context menu items "Compare" and "Compare Later" appear (hint: `nautilus -q` in terminal). Or if you prefer, a session restart will be more than enough. You also have to restart Nautilus after using `nautilus-compare-preferences` to change diff tools for the comparison.
